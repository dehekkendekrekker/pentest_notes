====== TFTP ======
Created Monday 18 October 2021

* Setup a TFTP server as described here: [[Tools:Linux:atftp]]
* Then upload a file as follows:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
tftp -i <host> put <file>
}}}


===== Remarks =====
* tftp.exe is not present on window7, server 2008 and above
* This technique uses UDP port 69
* It seems windows 10 (perhaps other versions too) block outgoing tftp traffic


===== Downloads =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
tftp -i <host> get <file>
}}}
