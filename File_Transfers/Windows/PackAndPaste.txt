====== PackAndPaste ======
Created Saturday 16 October 2021

This strategy involves the following
* Reduce the filesize of an executable (packing) with [[Tools:Linux:upx]]
* Turn the packed exe into a command script that will reinstate the original executable ([[Tools:Linux:exe2hex]])
* Copy + paste the command script into  a (dumb) terminal.

===== Example (with nc.exe) =====

=== Locate and copy nc.exe to the target directory ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
locate nc.exe | grep binaries
cp <location> <target>
}}}


=== Pack the exe ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
upx -9 <exe>
upx -t <exe>  # Testing is always good
}}}


=== Convert the exe into command script ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
exe2hex -x nc.exe -p nc.cmd
}}}

This will create a file nc.cmd

=== Copy contents of nc.cmd onto clipboard ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
cat nc.cmd | xclip -selection c
}}}


=== Paste into terminal window ===
Open your terminal window and hit CTRL+V

===== Remarks =====
* Requires powershell on the target machine
