{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
whoami							# Displays the current session's username
id								# Displays uid and gid id information of the groups the user belongs to
cat /etc/passwd 				# Displays a list of accounts on the system + additional information
hostname						# Displays the hostname of the target system
uname -a					    # Displays kernel version + architecture
cat /etc/issue					# Displays system info
ps -aux							# Displays running processes
cat /proc/version				# Displays OS + kernel version
cat /proc/version_signature		# Ubuntu: print kernel version
}}}

===== Remarks =====
* Presence of the www-data user indicates a webserver is likely installed

===== Network enumeration =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
ip a							# Displays interface information
route/routel					# Displays routing table
netstat/ss -anp 				# Displays active connections
}}}


==== Firewall enum ====
* Enumerating the firewall is a little harder on linux. The iptables-persistent package, if installed, stores the firewall configs in [[/etc/iptables.]] The files in the dir should be checked out for weak permissions so they might be read.
* Grepping the filesystem for "iptables", "iptables-save" or "iptables-restore"  might also lead to the file containing the firewall configuration


===== Enumerating scheduled tasks =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
ls -lah /etc/cron*				# Displays a listing of all scheduled tasks that are run according to their folder name
cat /etc/crontab				# Displays the system's crontab.Scripts in this file will often run as root. If we can edit the called script, we could use this for privesc
}}}




===== Enumerating installed programs, patch levels =====
On Debian based systems:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
dpkg -l							# Dumps a list of installed programs
}}}



===== Enumerating world writable directories: =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
}}}

* Finds all writable directories while redirecting errors to /dev/null

===== Enumerating (un)mounted disks =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
mount				#  Displays all mounted discs
cat /etc/fstab		#  Displays all discs that are mounted at boot
lsblk				#  Displays all block devices (discs + partitions
}}}


===== Enumerating modules =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
lsmod						# Lists status of kernel modules
/sbin/modinfo <module> 		# Shows info regarding <module>. Full pathname is required
}}}



===== Enumerating binaries that auto-elevate =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null				# Looks for files with the SUID bit set
}}}



===== Automatic enumeration =====
