===== Wordpress =====
Use [[Tools:Linux:wpscan]]

===== Enumeration =====
Use the following worlists when enumerating:
* /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt
* /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CGIs.txt  (See [[Technologies:CGI]])

==== Remarks ====
* Make sure to enumerate all subdirs when stuck
* When you have found a package, for instance a CMS, and the version is not immediately clear, find its repo and find the location of a README that might contain this info.



===== Look for: =====
* robots.txt
* sitemap.xml


===== Finding subdomains =====
Use VhostScan to find (sub)domain names on a certain host

Basic usage:
$ VHostScan -t (ip) -w (wordlistfile)

Advanced usage (example):
VHostScan -t 10.10.10.171 -w /usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz/general/common.txt --ignore-http-codes 400 --ignore-content-length 3138 --suffix ".htb"

Gobuster can also be used to enumerate subdomains: 
gobuster vhost <url> -w <worldlist>
