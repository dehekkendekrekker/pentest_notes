====== Kernel Vulnerabilities ======
Created Friday 22 October 2021

===== Enumeration =====
We need to enumerate well, as not to crash the system using a mismatched exploit.

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
cat /etc/issue			# yields information about the distro
uname -a				# Yields information about the kernel
arch					# Returns the system architecture
}}}


With this information we can now search for an exploit

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
searchsploit <distro> <arch> <kernel version>  # for instance
}}}


===== Find an exploit candidate =====
Compare the above information with info from the exploit

===== Compile =====
Compile the exploit (preferably on the target system) otherwise on the attacker's system. Be careful to compile for the right architecture
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
gcc <exploit.c> -o <exploit>
}}}


Todo: Cross compile info

===== Remarks =====

A kernel exploit might fail because you have no interactive shell.

===== Run =====
Finally run [[./<exploit]]> to privesc
