====== Password Attacks ======

===== Strategy =====

==== Word list (Dictionary) ====
* Tries every word in a list. 
* Can be purpose built for the set of passwords that need to be cracked
* Standard wordlists can be find on kali here: [[/usr/share/wordlists/.]] These are great for CTF, not for real engagements

=== Word list generation ===
* Use [[Tools:Linux:cewl]] to build a word list based off a website.
* Then use [[Tools:Linux:john]] to augment this base list with digits, special chars, etc


==== Brute force ====
* Try every single combination of lowercase, uppecase, digits and special characters
* Use [[Tools:Linux:crunch]] to create a brute-force list based on a known password policy



===== Cracking an authentication mechanism: =====

==== Word of caution: ====
* Brute forceing an authentication mechanism is noisy and may lead to DOS and the account you are brute-forcing being locked out.

==== Tools ====
* Use [[Tools:Linux:medusa]] for a simple to use brute-force tool that supports multiple protocols.
* [[Tools:Linux:crowbar]] is one of few tools that can brute-force the RDP protocol reliably. Supports RDP OpenVPN, SSH and VNC/


===== Retrieving hashes =====
* Use [[Tools:Linux:haiti]] to identify hashes
* Use [[Tools:Windows:mimikatz]] to extract hashes from memory on windows machines. (Admin access required)

===== Passing the hash =====
* Can only be done with NT and NTLM hashes
* Use [[Tools:Linux:pth:pth-winexe]] to pass the hash

===== Hash formats JTR =====
