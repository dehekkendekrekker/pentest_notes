====== msf-pattern offset ======
Created Monday 27 September 2021

Used to determine the offset of the word that overwrites the RIP/EIP in a payload generated by [[msf-pattern create]].

===== Usage =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
msf-pattern_offset -l <original length> -q <bytes>
}}}

<bytes> in this case is where the code tries to jump to, but can't as it's bogus.

===== Flags =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
-l				length of original payload created with msf-pattern_create
-q				query <bytes to look for>  This should be the literal feedback of the access violation, eg  42306142
}}}
