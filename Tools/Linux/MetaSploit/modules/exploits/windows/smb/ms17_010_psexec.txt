}}}


===== Description =====
  This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to 
  achieve a write-what-where primitive. This will then be used to 
  overwrite the connection session information with as an 
  Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec payload code 
  execution is done. Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and 
  WriteAndX requests and a race condition in Transaction requests, as 
  seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy 
  exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue 
  exploit, but requires a named pipe.
