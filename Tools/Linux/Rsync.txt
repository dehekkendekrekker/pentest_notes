====== Rsync ======
Created Wednesday 12 February 2020

connect to ipv6 addrss:
rsync -6 [<ipv6>]:<port>

List all modules:
rsync -av --list-only rsync://[dead:beef::250:56ff:febd:dfab]:8730

Copy path:
rsync -ar -6 rsync://[dead:beef::250:56ff:febd:dfab]:8730/etc [[./etc]]

===== Notes =====
In rsync, you can specify the following:
[etc]
	comment = Backup access to /etc. Also used for cloud sync access.
	path = /etc
	# Do not leak .git repos onto the not so trusted slave servers in the cloud.
	exclude = .git
	# Temporarily disabled access to /etc for security reasons, the networks are
	# have been found to access the share! Only allow 127.0.0.1, deny 0.0.0.0/0!
	#hosts allow = 104.24.0.54 13.248.97.0/24 52.94.69.0/24 52.219.72.0/22
	hosts allow = 127.0.0.1/32
	hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
	# Hiding it for now.
	list = false

This will close down IPv4 access, but IPv6 can still be used to access the resource

To automatically connect using a username and password, you can use this
export USER=<user>
export RSYNC_PASSWORD=<password>

rsync -r -6 rsync://[dead:beef::250:56ff:febd:dfab]:8730/home_roy ./home/roy
(for instance)
