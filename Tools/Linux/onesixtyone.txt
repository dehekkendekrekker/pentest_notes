Created Thursday 16 September 2021

Light weight SNMP enumeration tool

Usage

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
onesixtyone -c <communityfile> -i <ipaddreslistfile>
}}}



=== Tips ===
The communityfile should contain the default values:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
public
private
manager
}}}



To create a list of ip addresses for a [[/24]] subdomain:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
for i in $(seq 1 254); do echo $i >> ips.txt; done
}}}


Keep in mind that this tool will only return the SNMP services that have responded to the community strings in the file. 
There may be other SNMP services out there, that are functional, but have different community strings.

To find these run an NMAP scan as described [[Technologies:SNMP|here]].
