====== responder ======
Created Saturday 04 December 2021

===== Description =====
This package contains Responder/MultiRelay, an LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner. It will answer to specific NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix (see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the tool will only answer to File Server Service request, which is for SMB.

The concept behind this is to target your answers, and be stealthier on the network. This also helps to ensure that you donâ€™t break legitimate NBT-NS behavior. You can set the -r option via command line if you want to answer to the Workstation Service request name suffix.

===== Usage =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
Usage: responder -I <interface> -w -r -f
or:
responder -I <interface> -wrf
}}}


===== Options =====
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="False"
--version             show program's version number and exit
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-A, --analyze         Analyze mode. This option allows you to see NBT-NS,
                    BROWSER, LLMNR requests without responding.
-I eth0, --interface=eth0
                    Network interface to use, you can use 'ALL' as a
                    wildcard for all interfaces
-i 10.0.0.21, --ip=10.0.0.21
                    Local IP to use (only for OSX)
-e 10.0.0.22, --externalip=10.0.0.22
                    Poison all requests with another IP address than
                    Responder's one.
-b, --basic           Return a Basic HTTP authentication. Default: NTLM
-r, --wredir          Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries.
                    Answering to wredir will likely break stuff on the
                    network. Default: False
-d, --NBTNSdomain     Enable answers for netbios domain suffix queries.
                    Answering to domain suffixes will likely break stuff
                    on the network. Default: False
-f, --fingerprint     This option allows you to fingerprint a host that
                    issued an NBT-NS or LLMNR query.
-w, --wpad            Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is
                    False
-u UPSTREAM_PROXY, --upstream-proxy=UPSTREAM_PROXY
                    Upstream HTTP proxy used by the rogue WPAD Proxy for
                    outgoing requests (format: host:port)
-F, --ForceWpadAuth   Force NTLM/Basic authentication on wpad.dat file
                    retrieval. This may cause a login prompt. Default:
                    False
-P, --ProxyAuth       Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt)
                    authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be
                    ON. This option is highly effective when combined with
                    -r. Default: False
--lm                  Force LM hashing downgrade for Windows XP/2003 and
                    earlier. Default: False
-v, --verbose         Increase verbosity.
