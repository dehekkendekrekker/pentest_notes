====== shellter ======
Created Wednesday 20 October 2021

===== Installation =====
Kali:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo apt install shellter
}}}


Change [[/usr/bin/shellter]] to the following:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
"wineconsole" "/usr/share/windows-resources/shellter/shellter.exe" "$@"
}}}



===== Usage =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo shellter
}}}



You'll want to use the following options:
* Automatic
* Stealth. (This keeps the process running after the payload is executed)


===== Remarks/tips =====
* If you are using a custom rev-shell (recommended), use -f raw as output format
* This is a good base exe: /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/whoami.exe
* Sometimes a program will quit before tracing is complete. This borks the process, you'll need to restart and hit CTRL+C before the program exits
* Create a payload with [[MetaSploit:msfvenom]], but makes sure the architecture is x86, otherwise it won't work
