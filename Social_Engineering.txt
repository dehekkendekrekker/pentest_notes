===== Information gathering =====

Since attacking a target blindly is probably not going to be very succesful, here are outlined some techniques that could be used to gather information

===== Scenario 1 =====
* Apply to a job application using a reume in a file format that is designed to be un-openable
* You are likely going to get a reply saying the document could not be opened.
* This will provide an angle to ask about the software the are using, security features etc.
* It is IMPORTANT that the questions are balanced, low key and justified. ie, my cv uses special features to make it stand out and easily navigatable. This practice is called pretexting





==== TODO ====
* Learn more about pretexting
