====== NFS ======
Created Wednesday 15 September 2021

===== Network File Share =====

Distributed filesystem that allows a user to mount it as if it were a local filesystem.

===== About root squashing =====
* root squashing is the mapping of the client machine's user's uid to a different local uid, ie nobody. The effictively gives the remote root, 'other' permissions on the NFS.
* This is a security measure and as such, root squashing is the default.


===== Config file =====
The list of exports can be found in:
{{{code: lang="texinfo" linenumbers="False"
/etc/exports
}}}



=== NSE scripts ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/nfs*
}}}




=== Mounting an NFS share ===
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo mount <ip>:<mount> <local mount>
}}}


==== Troubleshooting ====
If you get this:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
Input/Output error
}}}

There maybe some incompatibilty of the implementation between server and client.
Try downgrading the version like this:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
sudo mount -o vers=3 <ip>:<mount> <local mount>
sudo mount -o vers=2 <ip>:<mount> <local mount>
}}}
