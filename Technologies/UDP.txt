Stateless protocol (fire and forget)



=== Port scanning ===

When portscanning for UDP ports, when a port is NOT firewalled and closed, an ICMP Destination Unreachable (Port unreachable) error should be returned.
Many portscanners regard the absense of this packet as an open port.
However, a firewall could block the sent packet, erronously marking the port as open
