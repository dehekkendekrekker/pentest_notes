====== Apache Tomcat ======
Created Saturday 27 November 2021


===== Description =====
Java Application Server

===== Components =====
* Catalina
* Jasper
* Coyote



==== Catalina ====
Catalina is Tomcat's servlet container. Catalina implements Sun Microsystems' specifications for servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP).
In Tomcat, a Realm element represents a "database" of usernames, passwords, and roles (similar to Unix groups) assigned to those users.

==== Coyote ====
Coyote is a Connector component for Tomcat that supports the HTTP 1.1 and 2 protocol as a web server.
This allows Catalina, nominally a Java Servlet or JSP container, to also act as a plain web server that serves local files as HTTP documents.
Coyote listens for incoming connections to the server on a specific TCP port and forwards the request to the Tomcat Engine to process the request and send back a response to the requesting client.
 Another Coyote Connector, Coyote JK, listens similarly but instead forwards its requests to another web server, such as Apache, using the JK Protocol.This usually offers better performance

===== Jasper =====
This is Tomcat's JSP engine. It takes JSP files, transforms them into java code, which can then be served up by Catalina.


===== What is a servlet =====
A Jakarta Servlet (formerly Java Servlet) is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. 
Although servlets can respond to many types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API.
Such web servlets are the Java counterpart to other dynamic web content technologies such as PHP and ASP.NET.
