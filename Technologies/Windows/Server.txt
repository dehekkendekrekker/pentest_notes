====== Server ======
Created Thursday 28 October 2021

There are three flavors of Windows Servers:
* Full desktop
* Server Core  (Slimmed down, no graphical interface)
* Server Nano (Even further slimmed down, no graphical interface)


Full desktop and Server Core can function as Domain Controllers, Nano cannot

==== Service Accounts ====
* Accounts that can be used to run services on. 
* These can be defined in Active Directory
There are three:
* LocalSystem
* LocalService
* NetworkService

==== Service Prinicpal Name ====
When  applications  like  Exchange,  SQL,  or  Internet  Information  Services  (IIS)  are  integrated  into ActiveDirectory,  a  unique  service  instance  identifier  known  as  a Service Principal Name(SPN) is used to associate a service on a specific server to a service account in Active Directory

==== Managed Service Accounts ====
* Managed Service Accounts, introduced with Windows Server 2008 R2, were designed for complex applications which require tighter integration with Active Directory. 
* Larger applications like SQL and Microsoft Exchange often require server redundancy when running to guarantee availability, but Managed Service Accounts cannot support this. 
* To remedy this, Group Managed Service Accounts were introduced with Windows Server 2012, but this requires that domain controllers run Windows Server 2012 or higher. 
* Because of this, many organizations still rely on basic Service Accounts
