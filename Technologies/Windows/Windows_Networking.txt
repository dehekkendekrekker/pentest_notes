===== Workgroups vs Domain =====
* Microsoft consider a workgroup a set of computers that are connecter peer2peer wise. This means each node has its own configuration, authentication scheme, etc.
* A domain is a set of computer that belong to the same group (Domain), and authenticate against the central Machine called the domain controller.
* The domain controller holds a database of computers, user, printers and security principles. This database is called active directory


===== Domain Controller =====
A server running Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) is called a domain controller
It authenticates and authorizes all users and computers in a Windows domain type networkâ€”assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.

===== Active Directory Services =====

==== 1. Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) ====

==== 2. Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) ====

==== 3. Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) ====
AD CS requires an AD DS infrastructure.

==== 4. Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) ====
Single sign-on service
AD FS requires an AD DS infrastructure, although its federation partner may not

==== 5. Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS) ====
