===== vmlinuz =====
* vmlinuz is the compressed kernel image. Sometimes called bzImage
* It is located on the boot-partition, and follows the naming convention vmlinuz-$(uname-r)
* When decompressed, its name is vmlinux, and it'll be the actual kernel ELF file






==== x32 ABI: ====


Running X32 binaries requires Debian kernel versions 3.14.15-1 and above with CONFIG_X86_X32 set. Additionally, syscall.x32=y must be present on the command line when booting the kernel, unless a custom kernel is built with CONFIG_X86_X32_DISABLED unset.

To activate X32 support in the default GRUB boot when using the default kernel, edit /etc/default/grub and modify these lines:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="syscall.x32=y quiet"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="syscall.x32=y"

After adding the lines, be sure to update the boot menu:

# update-grub2
