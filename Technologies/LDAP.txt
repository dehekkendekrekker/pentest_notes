===== Glossary =====

==== Attribute ====
Object classes are schema elements that specify collections of attribute types that may be related to a particular type of object, process, or other entity.

==== DN (Distinguished Name) ====
* Consists of 0 or more elements called Relative Distinguished Names (RDN)s
* Is much like a path on a filesystem
* An RDN consists of a <key>=<value> pair. Like dc=corp
* The following DN has 4 RDN's : firstname=joe, ou=users,dc=corp,dc=com. 
* The order of the RDN's determines the DN's position in the tree

==== Entry ====
* An LDAP entry is a collection of information about an entity. 
* Each entry consists of three primary components: a distinguished name, a collection of attributes, and a collection of object classes. 

==== Bind Operation: ====
A bind operation may be used to authenticate a client as a particular user as a means of verifying credentials, and to specify the authorization identity for subsequent operations performed on that connection. 

==== Object Classes ====
* Object classes are schema elements that specify collections of attribute types that may be related to a particular type of object, process, or other entity.
* In short, they determine which attributes an entry will get
