====== NetBIOS ======
Created Saturday 15 February 2020

NetBIOS, which stands for network basic input/output system, is a service that allows computers to communicate over a network. 
However, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol, it is an API. 
It runs over TCP/IP via the NBT protocol, allowing it to function on modern networks.

NetBIOS provides three distinct services:

	- Name service (NetBIOS-NS) for name registration and resolution.
	- Datagram distribution service (NetBIOS-DGM) for connectionless communication.
	- Session service (NetBIOS-SSN) for connection-oriented communication.
