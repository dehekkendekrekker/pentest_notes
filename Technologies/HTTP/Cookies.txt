====== Cookies ======

===== Cookies =====

Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Expires=<date>

}}}


==== Expires=<date> ====
The maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. If unspecified, the cookie becomes a session cookie.  A session finishes when the client shuts down, and session cookies will be removed.

==== Max-age=<number> ====
The maximum lifetime of the cookie as an HTTP-date timestamp. 
 If unspecified, the cookie becomes a session cookie.
 A session finishes when the client shuts down, and session cookies will be removed. 

==== Domain=<domain-value> ====
Host to which the cookie will be sent.
If omitted, defaults to the host of the current document URL, not including subdomains.
Contrary to earlier specifications, leading dots in domain names (.example.com) are ignored.
Multiple host/domain values are not allowed, but if a domain is specified, then subdomains are always included.

==== Path=<path-value> ====
A path that must exist in the requested URL, or the browser won't send the Cookie header.
The forward slash (/) character is interpreted as a directory separator, and subdirectories will be matched as well: for Path=/docs, /docs, /docs/Web/, and /docs/Web/HTTP will all match.

==== Secure ====
Cookie is only sent to the server when a request is made with the https: scheme (except on localhost), and therefore is more resistent to man-in-the-middle attacks.

==== HttpOnly ====
Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie, for example, through the Document.cookie property. 
Note that a cookie that has been created with HttpOnly will still be sent with JavaScript-initiated requests, e.g. when calling XMLHttpRequest.send() or fetch(). 
This mitigates attacks against cross-site scripting (XSS).

==== SameSite=<samesite-value> ====
Controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF). 

Inline options are: Strict, Lax, and None.

=== Notes ===
* The cookie-sending behavior if SameSite is not specified is SameSite=Lax. Previously the default was that cookies were sent for all requests.
* Cookies with SameSite=None must now also specify the Secure attribute (i.e. they require a secure context).


=== Strict ===
means that the browser sends the cookie only for same-site requests, that is, requests originating from the same site that set the cookie. If the request originated from a different URL than the current one, no cookies with the SameSite=Strict attribute are sent. 

=== Lax ===
means that the cookie is not sent on cross-site requests, such as calls to load images or frames, but is sent when a user is navigating to the origin site from an external site (e.g., if following a link). This is the default behavior if the SameSite attribute is not specified. 

=== None ===
means that the browser sends the cookie with both cross-site and same-site requests. The Secure attribute must also be set when SameSite=None!
