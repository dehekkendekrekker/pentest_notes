===== Oracle MTS Service: =====
Oracle provides support to Microsoft Transaction Server for carrying out operations where COM components are involved. 
As Oracle works in distributed structure model where number of clients connect to main server, this service proves beneficial.
 This service is implemented through OCI (i.e. Oracle Call Interface). The process listed for this service is OMTSRECO.exe which runs in the context of running Host.
 The MTS acts as a distributed transaction coordinator to manage and control the transactions taking place in a distributed way. 
The transactions are controlled by placing a proxy component termed as Oracle MTS (i.e. OraMTS) between database and DTC. 
Firstly all the working behavior is based on communication between the processes but with new features the paradigm has shifted to intra processes.
This provides per process control over the transaction taking place. The MSDTC supports the OraMTS.
 It is straight forward depicts that Host running the Oracle MTS service will be a Windows machine.
On patched versions of Microsoft Windows the MSDTC is a serious vulnerable base for exploiting the system.
