====== TNS ======
Created Friday 26 November 2021


The Oracle TNS Listener Service is a centralized point where every single node of a system connects. 
Basically the TNS listener is supported well in database clusters and even centralized servers in a production environment. 
The client connects to the server through the listener to run queries directly on the database with connect calls.
 All the queries are executed remotely and the changes take place in the Oracle database. 
The TNS means Transport Layer Substrate. It manages the remote command execution mechanism and traffic between client and server. 
The Oracle suite is comprised of the TNS listener component for server side and the TNS Control component on client side. 
The connection is initiated through TNS control utility which is accepted by the TNS Listener. 
The TNSNAMES.ORA and SQLNET.ORA are the configuration files for the TNS listener.

 But for effective use the auditor has to create a LISTENER.ORA with same configuration semantics as described in the other two files. 
The prime aim is to set a connection string coupled with the type of service requested from the Oracle server. 
When the SQL*PLUS is executed for interactive query execution, it checks the service type. 
If the service type is not specified and not supported by the Oracle server, the TNS listener fails to set the connection.Thatâ€™s the exact way to set the listener.
 The service name is critical to set a client properly. It generates many errors with a badly configured parameter. 
This point comes into play when the auditor has to set a client while testing. This strategy will be discussed with thin clients in the next part. 
The Oracle TNS Listener is a high risk vulnerability issue when not applied properly. The output shows that the default port 1521 which is in listening state. 
By conducting further fingerprinting one can analyze whether this component is vulnerable or not.

These three processes constitute the Oracle working in a high end production environment. This needs to be understood efficiently when an audit is to be conducted
