====== CVE-2021-1675 ======
Created Tuesday 07 December 2021

===== Name =====
* PrintNightmare

===== Description =====

* The vulnerability is in the RpcAddPrinterDriver call of the Windows Print Spooler. A client uses the RPC call to add a driver to the server, storing the desired driver in a local directory or on the server via SMB. The client then allocates a DRIVER_INFO_2 object and initializes a DRIVER_CONTAINER object that contains the allocated DRIVER_INFO_2 object. The DRIVER_CONTAINER object is then used within the call to RpcAddPrinterDriver to load the driver. This driver may contain arbitrary code that will be executed with SYSTEM privileges on the victim server. This command can be executed by any user who can authenticate to the Spooler service.
