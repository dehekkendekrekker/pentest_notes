====== Defeating Canaries ======
Created Tuesday 28 April 2020

You can defeat a stack canary by brute-force when the program has a forking server architecture.
The stack canary is set when the program starts, and does not change over the course of the program.
When the program forks-on-connect and has a buffer overflow vulnerability that would allow you to
overwrite the RIP, you can brute-force the canary byte-by-byte.

See the solution for the "old bridge" challenge of the htb pwn challenges for more info.
