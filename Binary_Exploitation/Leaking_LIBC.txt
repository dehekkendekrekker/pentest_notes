====== Leaking LIBC ======
Created Monday 11 October 2021

Leaking the base address of LIBC is necessary when you are forced to use a ROP approach, due to a Non Executable stack.

It involves finding  ROP gadgets in the binary you are attacking.

Prerequisites:
* You have control over the intstruction pointer
* You've got access to the program's binary
* ASLR can be on or off, this is not relevant
* Preferably, you know which LIBC version the target is using, although this can be derived by calculating the offset difference of two funtions.
